# Hubway-bike-sharing
Bluebikes, originally Hubway, is a bicycle sharing system in the Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan area. 
The system is owned by the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Everett, and Somerville and Town of Brookline, and is 
operated by Motivate. The system uses technology provided by 8D Technologies, as well as PBSC Urban Solutions for 
bikes, parts, and docking stations. The bike share program officially launched in Boston as Hubway on July 28, 
2011 with 61 stations and 600 bicycles. In the spring of 2012, more stations were added in Boston as well as 
the neighboring municipalities of Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville.

Data preprocessing was done by lubricate and geosphere libraries by generating new features.
